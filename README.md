# A Scheme Implementation In Haskell


A Scheme Interpreter built in Haskell for the Mathematics Directed Reading Program at Western University under the mentorship of Jarl Gunnar Taxeras Flaten.

Learnt pure and impure functional programming, and applied basic category theory to approach solving required programming problems in Haskell.

## Project Highlights

- Monads used to compose parsers bottom-up
- Monads used to handle side-effects such as IO
- Monads used to handle control flow 
- Monads used for environment binding
- Monad transformers user to combine monadic error handlers and evaluators
- A implemented standard library of functions in Scheme itself
- Support for self-modifying code with Macros wuth `define-syntax`


## Presentation

The final presentation given at the end of the project is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x-kyG7-GZ0b0D9b5gAK4EcWrnG6GSMASsW_8l7_bqrA/edit#slide=id.gcee42cd350_0_100).

It only covers parts of the implementation relevant to mathematicians.
